<div class="contentboxmain"><p class="titlelink">Additional Information</p>
  <p class="documentparagraph">Kenneth Freeman - Red Team Leader<br>Stan Howser - Blue Team Leader<br>Shonda Ford - Yellow Team Leader
  <br><br>
  Christie Buckley - Tranferring from Marketing to Social Media Content Management (Restructuring)<br>
  Diannah Larimore - Being Layed Off from Marketing (Restructuring)<br>
  Paul G - Transferring from Office Administration to Executive Administration (Promotion)<br>
  Bettie M - Tranferring from Internship Program to Development (Permanant Hire)<br>
  Timothy M - Transferring from Internship Program to Social Media Content Management (Permanant Hire)<br>
  Maria A - Being Layer Off from Marketing (Restructuring)
  <br><br>
  According to something Vanessa says in The Therapist Tapes, Luis may have transferred from IT to Marketing at some point.
  <br><br>
  Vanessa Afton - Transferring from Security to Security (Transfer Request). The "Security" Position that Vanessa's Transfering Into is as Chief Security Officer at The PizzaPlex. Despite a Lack of Experience, Vanessa was accepted for the position, likely due to Manipulation from a Corporate Head of Fazbear Entertainment.
  <br><br>
  After Fazbear Entertainment realized that The Afton Virus had infiltrated The Fazbear Funtime Service Systems, they ordered The Client Company to cease all work on the Project. Work on The Fazbear Funtime Service was continued by 4 or more Employees at Fazbear Entertainment.
  <br><br>
  In the process of being taken over by Glitchtrap, Jeremy likely sliced his own face off with a Guillotine Paper Slicer, while it's not confirmed what happened to him after that, odds are he went on to work at DLZ Shipping Solutions (according to his Leaked Email Address) if he survived the ordeal. Perhaps this job change was a part of Williams Plan to infiltrate The Fazbear Funtime Service.
  <br><br>
  Inconsistencies in Tape Girl's Final Tapes point to her falling under the Influence of Glitchtrap, however her current whereabouts & identity are unknown. It's possible that her Real Name is Gabriella, Tonya, or someone we've still yet to meet. With her potentially being a Symbolic "VR Sister" to Vanessa, she may still be vital to Williams plans.
  <br><br>
  Lisa Jameson of The Fazbear Funtime Service Distribution Center reaches out to Jimmy Hauss of DLZ Shipping Solutions about Shipment & Animatronic Issues, however by the Final message to DLZ, Jimmy is "No Longer An Employee of DLZ Shipping Solutions". This dissapearance goes Unexplained.
  <br><br>
  As is the topic of a complaint lodged at The PizzaPlex about an employee named Dave, "He Sucks"
  <br><br>
  Vanny is likely responsible for the Disappearances & Deaths of all her Therapists. Atleast one was found Dead, Mangled in some Machinery likely housed at Fazbear Entertainment. The whereabouts of the rest are Unknown.
</p>
<p class="titlelink">Channel Management</p>
<p class="documentparagraph">It's a bit tricky to understand how exactly each Client Company interacts with the others in order for The Fazbear Funtime Service to function properly, however odds are the System looks something like this. The Behavior of The Fazbear Funtime Service Animatronics is dictated by a System developed by The Client Company which is no longer a part of the Service. Since that Company was let go from the Project, a group of Employees at Fazbear Entertainment have been responsible for designing the Services New Animatronics. These new Animatronics & Their Parts are Shipped to the Distribution Warehouse by DLZ Shipping Solutions. The Distribution Warehouse is responsible for Housing, Assembling, Repairing, and Distributing all Funtime Service Delivery Animatronics.</p>
