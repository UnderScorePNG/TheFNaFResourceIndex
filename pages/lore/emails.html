                <br>Dear User,
                <br>
                <br>Welcome to the unlimited fun of having a full-sized animatronic visiting you!
                <br>
                <br>In a very small percentage of orders certain malfunctions have been reported. In the extremely unlikely event you encounter one of these malfunctions, we hope this helpful guide will prove invaluable to you getting your fun back on track.
                <br>
                <br><b>Q: Animatronic's <i>Animstealth™</i> technology is not turning off, making the animatronic difficult to see.</b>
                <br>A: Active <i>Animstealth™</i> systems will cause static when video cameras are pointed directly at a stealthed animaronic. Turning on the <b>flashlight</b> function on your interface has been known to substantially help detecting the static. <i>Be aware that this has been known to adversely affect battery lifespan, however!</i>
                <br>
                <br><b>Q: Animatronic has caused injuries to property, persons, or pets.</b>
                <br>A: Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for any accidental damage or injuries. Please direct all claims or legal action to Fredrick, Fredrick & Sons law firm.

                <br>Greetings from Fazb//...ar Ent##_!ment!
                <br>
                <br>Isn't the best thing about the Eternal Package is it keeps going and going and going?
                <br>
                <br>Our transponders have notified us that you have borrowed the use of one of our animatronics for a bit. That's A-okay with us! We understand completely - in your shoes, we'd want to keep one of Freddy's friends around forever, too!
                <br>
                <br>As we're sure you have already discovered, you can send animatronics out to do your dirty work like picking up spare parts, scaring your friends. An animatronic will stay out salvaging until it's system detects an imminent fault and it auto-recalls, or you explicitly order it to recall, at which point you will need to use those spare parts to repair it back up to where it is as good as new!
                <br>
                <br>Remember, regular maintenance will keep your new friends in tip-top working order.

                <br> Hey, Ness,
                <br>
                <br>I hope you're having a good day! It's no big deal, but I wanted to reach out 'off the radar,' and remind you about the company policy about personal internet usage. Nobody cares if you're online shopping, as long as you get your work done - I promise, I've done my share of last-minute gift-buying! But certain words and phrases trigger red flag reports, so your last order got automatically sent to me: basically anything mentioning 'torture' is going to raise the alarm. So although the <i>Viking Blood Eagle Twelve-Month Calendar</i> you ordered is very cool, the searches that got you there did trigger a red flag.
                <br>
                <br>If you have any questions about the policy, let me know. We could even get coffee or something and go over all the words to avoid.
                <br>
                <br>...And now I've raised my own red flag! Good thing I'm the one who gets the notification :-)

                <br> Hey, Ness,
                <br>
                <br>Just a quick FYI - I know I mentioned trigger words, but the AI is actually a little more sophisticated than that, and of course there are people like me watching the system, too.
                <br>
                <br>So, the word <i>compliance</i> by itself isn't going to set off any red flags, but the sentence <i>how to induce compliance in human subjects</i>, and <i>how to induce self-compliance(?)</i> did actually get my attention. (I think the answer might involve chocolate chip cookies? Always works on me.)
                <br>
                <br>I also thought it was strange that these were immediately followed by searches that couldn't possibly have any relevant answers for you. Did you search for 'help' by itself?
                <br>
                <br>Anyway, my offer still stands if you want to go over the company policy. I'm free any day after work - we could grab dinner or coffee if you want. In the meantime you might want to do some of your more... interesting research at home.

                <br> Fazbear just ordered us to stop working. It sounds like they're halting work with all their contractors, not just us. They said they'll be in touch about ‘our future course of action.'

                <br> Hey, Ness,
                <br>
                <br>I wanted to see if you're doing ok. I appreciate your taking my advice about red flag search terms, if I thought I'd have to file an incident report on you, I think I'd just have to quit instead. So, my student loans thank you!
                <br>
                <br>I do have to keep checking online activity periodically after getting a red flag report, and I was a little worried maybe something is going on with you? One day you're researching flowers and the migration patterns of bees (fascinating, right?) and the next day you type in 'How far can a human being be cut in half before losing consciousness'.
                <br>
                <br>I figured, maybe you're writing a screenplay or something? But it was a little startling to see it written out. I hope you know I'm always here if you need me.
                <br>

                <br>I hope things are good! I saw you ordered three 'lifelike, human male rubber masks' and I was dying to ask what they're for - was my screenplay guess right? Are you making a movie, or putting together some kind of performance?

                <br>
                <br>We have a virus spreading through our system, and we've traced it back to one of the circuit board scans we performed for Fazbear Entertainment. Are you aware of this issue? Can you send any guidance?

                <br> Hey, Ness,
                <br>
                <br>It was really great talking to you today. I think that might be the first time we've actually had an in-person conversation lol. It's weird, I feel like I know you so well, but I guess you don't know so much about me. We're just going to have to fix that!
                <br>
                <br>I had no idea you were into IT stuff. I always think my job sounds so boring, but you were so interested it made me start thinking, hey, maybe IT is cool after all. Or maybe you're just a good listener. Anyway, it was nice to have some in-person time. Maybe we can do it again soon. I still owe you that coffee I keep saying we should get.

                <br>
                <br>Is everything OK? I came by your desk to say hi today and I don't think you even heard me. You had your face so close to the screen, that can't be good for your eyes (I know, I know, I sound like somebody's grandma). I waited for a second to see if you would turn around, but it was like you were in another world. It must be useful to be able to shut out the world and focus like that, I wish I could do it. I thought you were on a conference call at first because I heard voices.
                <br>
                <br>Ness, if you ever want to talk about anything, I'm always here for you. I thought your hair looked nice today, the rainbow streaks brightened up the office - and the office is always in desperate need of some brightening!

                <br>
                <br> Hey, Ness,
                <br>
                <br>I'm probably overstepping here, but I feel like I might be the only one in a position to know something's wrong.
                <br>
                <br>Because, Ness, something really is wrong. You're amazing, I hope you know that - anybody would be lucky just to know you. And, I was willing to believe that you were just writing a screenplay, or interested in history; maybe the book about human dissection, and the anatomical models of organs were because you're thinking about going to medical school. People have all kinds of interests, right? But when you're actually ordering thumbscrews and having them delivered to the office, that just seems like a cry for help.
                <br>
                <br>It's like there's two sides of you, and I get that - I feel like that, too. Some days, I'm unstoppable, and some days I'm just... stopped. There's the bright, happy side of you that orders cupcake cookbooks, and rainbow hair extensions, and that glittery pink journal with all the pictures of puppies, and that's great.
                <br>
                <br>But then there's the side of you that ordered chocolate and flowers for yourself and pretended they were from your boyfriend 'Brad.' I'm not judging you for being lonely - I definitely understand where you're coming from there. But, Ness, I also saw what you had written on that card. 'Flowers for your grave'? Why would you have an imaginary boyfriend who's threatening to kill you? You know that's not healthy, right?
                <br>
                <br>If you want to talk about anything, please call me, or write back, or just tap me on the shoulder at work. I might not understand exactly what you're going through, but I've been through some tough times of my own, and what got me through was letting people in, not shutting them out.
                <br>
                <br>I'm here for you, Ness, I really am. All you have to do is ask.
                <br>

                <br> Hey, Ness,
                <br>
                <br>You know what? I realized, I'm always asking if you're OK, as if I'm some kind of perfect guy who's always OK and has everything figured out. So I just wanted to say, it's fine if you're not OK.
                <br>
                <br>I'm not always OK either. I mean, things are good - I've got a good job, right? People think it's awesome that I work for Fazbear Entertainment, they think I play games all day. Does that happen to you too? I think they get confused because I do computer stuff, but I don't work on the actual games. So whenever people hear I do computer stuff and I work for Fazbear, they assume I work on games, then they're disappointed, and I'm disappointed for disappointing them. It's kind of a bummer. I like my job OK though. It's where I met you, after all.
                <br>
                <br>I guess I just thought I'd know what I was doing with my life by now. I thought if I studied hard and got a good job, everything else would fall into place. Turns out, all I learned by studying hard to get a good job was how to study and work. All that time I thought other people were wasting, dating and hanging out doing nothing - they were learning how to date and hang out. I never really got the hang of that stuff. That's why I'm spending Saturday night writing to a beautiful girl who never writes back.
                <br>
                <br>I wish you would write back. Or talk to me at work, like the other day. I felt like you really got me that day. I know I don't totally get you, Ness, but I want to, if you would just let me.

                <br><b>ATTENTION</b>
                <br>The office kitchen is a shared resource, and it is everyone's responsibility to keep it clean. If you <i>only</i> use the coffeemaker YOU ARE STILL USING THE KITCHEN, and you are still responsible for helping to keep it clean.
                <br>
                <br>Todd and Cheryl are kind enough to clean our common areas as part of their weekly duties. They are NOT responsible for cleaning up your personal mess.
                <br>
                <br>(1) Wash your dishes: this includes coffee spoons
                <br>(2) The drying rack is not a storage rack. When your items are dry please put them away in the cabinets or take them to your desk.
                <br>(3) Label your food. If you do not label your food, you lose the right to complain when somebody takes it.
                <br>(4) Don't take food that isn't yours, even if it isn't labeled. We live in a civil society.
                <br>(5) If you take the last cup of coffee, make a new pot. If there is less than one cup of coffee left after you take your cup of coffee, make a new pot.
                <br>
                <br>If we all adhere to these simple rules, the kitchen will be a more pleasant place for us all.

                <br>Fine. But I want it noted in writing what my department reported.
                <br>
                <br>Toy Freddy is <i>not</i> safe to go out to the public. The interface happening with the upgraded facial recognition suite risks rendering <i>all</i> the safety functions on the users" handsets useless.

                <br>Dear User
                <br>
                <br>We hope you're continuing to enjoy the exhilerating expierence of our Eternal Package!
                <br>
                <br><b>Q: "Toy" animatronic behaves eratically and shows subsequent aggressive - but perfectly harmless tendencies.</b>
                <br>A: Our brand new "Toy" animatronics have been given an upgraded facial recognition suite. Due to the rigorous new software, customers should attempt to use the new Freddy Fazbear Mask in the very rare case that the facial recognition software encounters a fatal logic loop.
                <br>
                <br>A factory fault has been reported where Toy Freddy's <i>Animstealth™</i> module sometimes conflicts with the animatronic's upgraded facial recognition software,causing significant handset battery drain when the animatronic detects a human nearby. We are currently working on a patch, but in the meantime, users can reduce the severity of this behavior by putting their Freddy Fazbear Mask on whatever an unexpected battery drain is observed.
                <br>
                <br>Please note that this issue is in addition to the existing issue we are still working hard on where all Toy-series animatronics may occasionally move erratically and subsequently display visibly aggressive behavior. As with the Toy Chica model, temporarily placing the provided Freddy Fazbear Mask on your head and not looking away for the duration of the logic loop fault should resolve the situation in most instances.

                <br>Hey Tristan,
                <br>
                <br>We've been getting some weird reports here in Customer Service that I don't really know how to respond to.
                <br>
                <br>A handful of our more hardcore users of the service have been reporting service calls from an animatronic that isn't appearing anywhere in our database. Some knd of vintage Bonnie model. A couple of people have mentioned a really bad smell from it as well.
                <br>
                <br>Is it possible some old second hand model somehow made it into the deployment rotation?

                <br>Nora,
                <br>
                <br>I've been looking over those reports on the motility tests for the new model and I gotta say I'm a little disturbed by the lack of progress. The original was purportedly able to move along the ceiling, and from what I'm seeing here, we're having issues getting our rebuilds to even move on level ground properly.
                <br>
                <br>What kind of shop are you guys running down there? The marketing guys are lighting fires under me to promise we'll hit the launch date for this, and what I'm seeing is not filling me with confidence.

                <br>
                <br>First, tell the marketing people to go jump off a bridge. They just have to write some fancy copy while we're down here trying to make their crazy promises work in reality on unrealistic budgets and completely insane timelines. We're doing the best we can.
                <br>
                <br>Second, there's a <i>huge</i> difference between a new model based on the same bipedal chassis and one based on a... whatever you want to call this thing. A quadreped? A spider? A tripod? The locomotion is <i>completely</i> different, which means the power needs are different, the hydraulic calibrations have to be completely redone, and the CPU has to be switched out for a newer one with a faster baud rate. And then on top of all that, we have to put together this "Controlled Disassembly" feature? The marketing people are crazy. Third, GET OFF MY BACK!!! I <i>warned</i> management that reproducing the more exotic endoskeletons would be a problem, and they decided to go ahead and put them on the schedule anyways. They're just going to have to live with the limitations of, you know, <i>basic physics.</i>

                <br>Sorry to bother you, but wanted to confirm that there were no changes on the circuit board side of things?
                <br>

                    <br>What do your people think, a computer controlled animatronic can somehow get into the holiday spirit and reprogram itself? It's just a machine controlled by a circuit board. It has to do what we tell it to and nothing more.

                <br>
                <br>By now, you might have noticed that your shocker has been replaced with an upgraded tool. Due to recent upgrades, some of your Eternal Package Animatronics have been improved in durability to help ensure that they m#ke it safely to your doorstep. Unfortunately, this increased du##bility has caused them to be harder to deactivate in the event of an entirely unlik#ly emer###cy.
                <br>
                <br>To t#at end, we've taken the liberty of upgrading your sho##er device to the new <b>Diagnostic and Repair Multitool 2.0.</b>
                <br>
                <br>What's new:
                <br>- Durability - Animatronics now have incr##sed
                <br>
                <br> - Shocker boosting - To aid in over#####g the animatronic's durability, you are now #### to increase your shocker's electrical output. Tempo##ry Boosts and Permanent Upgrades are available.
                <br>
                <br> - Shields - Bec###e the animatronic may take more attempts to deactivate, your multit##l is equipped with Shields to help protect you from the malfunctioning attacks. Each attack will weaken your shields, depending on the power level of the animatronic.
                <br>
                <br> - Animatronic Power Level - The ani####onics need more power to support the updated chassis design, which will cause them to inflict more dam### on your shield in the event of an attack. The infor####on is available in the Scan screen of the animatronic.
                <br>
                <br> - Loadouts - Your multitool is now able to carry activatable buffs to use while interacting w##h each animatronic.
