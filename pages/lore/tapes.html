  <p class="titlelink">Help Wanted Glitched Tapes</p>
<div class="contentboxmain"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T1">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 1</strong><br>Hello? Can you hear me? Don't exit this room, ok? This isn't a mistake. This room isn't a mistake. I had to hide these logs away from the core gameplay files in a place that only a beta tester would look and in a place where the files could be protected. I just really, really hope that the next development team finds this before the game is released to the public. This game has some kind of malicious code in it that we haven't been able to fully contain or even understand for that matter. We're over-budget and out of time. But that's not the reason that we're shutting down. Listen, I have to keep this short so the file size will be small enough to fly under the radar. There are more. They may not be in order.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T2">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 2</strong><br>I saw it for the first time today. There was a character, I couldn't make out who it was, standing at the end of the hall. I thought it was just bugged out, so I made a note of it and kept playing. But then it was looking in the window. And not like Chica or Bonnie would. It was like it was actually looking in the window, seeing what I was doing.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T3">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 3</strong><br>I heard a pretty heated conversation this morning between Dale - our manager - and someone else on the line. It really feels like this project is in trouble, in no small part because of the lawsuit I'm sure. There has to be a lawsuit. There's no way there isn't. It happened in this building just a few doors down from me. I think it's made worse by the fact that Jeremy tried to tell us something was wrong. But as a dev team, we all just saw it as a challenge to find what the problem was and fix it. Who could have known that- I have to go.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T4">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 4</strong><br>Have you ever heard of a guillotine paper slicer? It sounds made up, but it's an actual piece of office equipment. I didn't even know we had one in the supply room. I guess they're more common at businesses that do a lot of graphic design work. I remember seeing one when I was still in school, and even then I knew how dangerous it looked. I was always afraid of losing a finger. That seems so silly now. Jeremy used to do design work. I guess that's how he knew it was there.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T5">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 5</strong><br>The drawers have been emptied out. Someone was here. I don't think it was spring cleaning either. No, there was plastic on the floor. Someone was definitely here during the night. It had to have been the client. I mean, they sent us that stuff in the first place with no explanation. Told us to scan it. Said it would expedite the process so we wouldn't need to program any path finding ourselves. It was a budget things, I guess. It was just junk- circuit boards and things like that. Looked pretty old. Somehow, though, there was usable code on some of it. It seemed to take hold by itself. Things started changing. But then, he started appearing. At least, that's what Jeremy said.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T6">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 6</strong><br>I came in early that morning. No one else was there. At least, that's what I thought. The supply room was lit. I didn't even notice Jeremy standing in the testing room as I walked past. The supply room was so bright - glowing from all the way down the hall.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T7">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 7</strong><br>Jeremy complained of nightmares when he came in this morning. He wasn't talking about it like someone telling a friend about his dreams, though. He was pale. Looked like he hadn't eaten in days. He spent an hour talking in Dale's office. But it didn't look like he was given much sympathy. When he came out, he went directly back to the testing room. He doesn't even jump anymore. Nothing scares him. He just stands there like he's talking to someone. Sometimes he rocks from side to side. We were told to leave him alone. I knew I was in line to do the testing next. They'd been prepping me for it. I guess they knew that Jeremy would need to be replaced soon.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T8">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 8</strong><br>You can always tell when a company is getting ready to fire someone. They start giving out written warnings for silly things, making sure to make a paper trail and make a case for a firing. Things that normally no one would care about suddenly become grave offenses, all worthy of being written and documented. I guess it works two ways, because it also encourages a person to quit rather than be scrutinized so heavily. I think Jeremy was too far gone to consider that option though. The thing about it is, that I don't think they were going to fire him because of anything he was doing wrong. They just knew he'd seen something. They needed to discredit him.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T9">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 9</strong><br>There was something that looked like a Halloween mask laying on the floor. I didn't understand. Ink must have spilled. It was only then that I heard a shuffle from the testing room and realized Jeremy must be there. I went back and peered in the window. I couldn't see his face. He had the visor covering his head. He had ink spilled on himself as well. The front of his shirt looked black in the dark room. He turned his head in my direction, but I don't think he knew I was there.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T10">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 10</strong><br>I was told I had three days to finish Jeremy's work, but I know it's just passing the time. They don't really expect me to do anything. It's just to keep up appearances until the buyout is complete. We have to look like we have things under control. There's another potential development studio that wants to pick up from here. But who knows what kind of lies they're being fed to convince them to do it. Against my better judgement, I'm going to do my best to see what's here, make notes of it, and try to isolate where this thing is hiding. At least then, the next person that tests this will have a chance of getting rid of it.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T11">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 11</strong><br>Today was my last day of beta testing and the anomaly that I've been seeing is nowhere to be found. But after inspecting some of the files, it seems that it's attached itself to these logs. My logs. That can't be an accident. So now I have to make a choice. Do I leave these logs here for you to find or do I try to purge this thing myself by destroying the logs. I've chosen the latter.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T12">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 12</strong><br>I can't delete them. By creating a protected area to store these logs apart from the game, I effectively gave this thing a safe place to hide itself. It's in here now. I may not be able to delete it. But I might be able to do something else now that it's attached itself. I have an idea.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T13">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 13</strong><br>They lied to us. They lied to all of us. They told us that the whole point of this VR game was to undo the bad PR done by a rogue indie game developer, who supposedly made up a bunch of crazy stories that tarnished the brand. But that’s not true at all! In their haste to develop this VR game and clear their name, they sent us some things I don’t think they intended us to see. Such as a hard drive containing e-mails between Fazbear Entertainment and a certain indie developer. Fazbear Entertainment hired the game developer. Those indie games were designed to conceal and make light of what happened. This isn’t just an attempt to rebrand. It’s an elaborate cover-up. A campaign to discredit everything.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T14">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 14</strong><br>I ran a fragmentation program on the area of memory that was storing these logs for you. I effectively broke the files into pieces, and broke the anomaly along with it. That means that you won’t have my warnings to guide you. But hopefully, it also means that this anomaly, this virus, or whatever it is, will remain broken and unable to do more damage.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T15">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 15</strong><br>Hello. You don’t know me. I'd created a series of logs for you documenting the troubled development of this VR game that you’re now testing in hopes that you, whoever you are, and whatever team you are with, will abandon development. Now I fear that those logs are being used as a Trojan horse. If you're unable to abandon development, hide all traces of these logs that I’ve created. I fear that finding them and reassembling them will also reassemble the very thing I’ve tried so desperately to destroy.
</p><hr class="documenthr"><p class="documentparagraph" id="T16">
  <strong style="font-size:16px;">Tape 16</strong><br>There is a way to kill it. It wants to escape. To escape through someone. Someone plugged into this game. That's...you now... You have to let it begin the process of leaving through you, then use the disconnect switch that I've embedded by the main stage. Let it approach you. Let it begin to merge with you. Play the music and flip the switch. That will cause a hard restart of the game and flush the memory, effectively killing it, I hope. I don't know when it will come for you.

<div class="contentboxmain"><p class="titlelink">Additional Information</p>
  <p class="documentparagraph">The Tapes or "Logs" were created by an Employee of Silver Parasol Games during the making of The Freddy Fazbear Virtual Experience. Early in the process of Programming Path Finding, Fazbear Entertainment sent Silver Parasol Games a collection of Circuit Boards to expedite the process. Most of these Circuit Boards were useless, however some of them clung to The Game. These useful Circuit Boards contained Glitchtrap AKA a portion of William Afton. Glitchtraps main objective was to spread beyond The VR Game by infiltrating the minds of its Playtesters.</p>
  <hr class="documenthr">
  <p class="documentparagraph"><strong style="font-size:16px;">Playtester 1 - Jeremy</strong><br>Jeremy was an Employee of Silver Parasol Games & the first to encounter Glitchtrap. His Playtesting of the Game lead to a sharp decline in Mental Health, likely the result of resisting Glitchtraps Manipulation. This corruption eventually lead to Jeremy slicing his own face off with a Guillotine Paper Slicer housed in the Supply Room, however he likely survives his injuries. Fazbear Entertainment realizes their mistake & reclaims the Physical Circuit Boards from Silver Parasol, however the damage is already done. This incident causes a Lawsuit to be filed against Silver Parasol Games who are forced to sell The VR Game off to another company who can finish it.
  <br><br>While Jeremy may have been successfull in slicing his own face off out of resistance, odds are Glithtrap still managed to infiltrate his Mind. Jeremy's Leaked AR Email Address suggests that he likely went on to work at DLZ Shipping Solutions, a company who ships Animatronic Parts to The Animatronic Distribution Warehouse. Jeremy may have been a part of Vanessas Infiltration of The Fazbear Funtime Service & may still be vital to Williams Plans.</p>
  <hr class="documenthr">
  <p class="documentparagraph"><strong style="font-size:16px;">Playtester 2 - Tape Girl</strong><br>Tape Girl was an Employee of Silver Parasol Games who witnessed Jeremys decline Into Madness. After Jeremys Incident, She replaced him as the Games new Playtester, &, following her first encounter with Glitchtrap, started making the Tapes/Logs. These Logs were meant to document her encounters with Glitchtrap & experiences on The Project. She created a Hidden Room to hide The Tapes away from The Games Main Content, however this backfired in a way. Glitchtrap attatched itself to Tape Girls Logs, effectively giving it a Safe Place to Hide as well. Tape Girl ran a Fragmentation Program on The Tapes, basically breaking Glitchtrap apart with The Tapes, however this division would only last as long as The Tapes remained divided as well. Tape Girl creates a new Tape instructing Future Development Teams to Abandon Development & Hide all traces of The Logs.
  <br><br>Whats strange is that Tape Girls Final Log is supposed instructions on how to Kill Glitchtrap. These instructions involve the player letting Glitchtrap begin a Digital Consciousness Tranference before hitting The Disconnect Switch Tape Girl Embedded by The Main Stage to Flush the Memory & Kill Glitchtrap. This abrupt switch in attitude suggests that Tape Girl has already fallen under the control of Glitchtrap, & is setting a Trap with her Final Log. If this process could actually Eliminate Glitchtrap, then wouldn't she have Killed Him already? The process Tape Girl describes results in Help Wanteds Ending where Vanessa is locked behind a Safe Room Door with Glitchtrap leaving on the other side, suggesting that The Digital Consciousness Transference was Successfull.
  <br><br>Tape Girls current whereabouts are Unknown, however she may still be vital to Williams Plans. Tape Girl may be a Symbolic "VR Sister" to Vanessa, establishing her importance beyond just Help Wanted. Tape Girls True Name may be either "Tonya" or "Gabriella", however we can't be 100% certain of either.</p>
  <hr class="documenthr">
  <p class="documentparagraph"><strong style="font-size:16px;">Playtester 3 - Vanessa Afton</strong><br>Vanessa Afton is a Security Employee of Fazbear Entertainment. After The Freddy Fazbear Virtual Experience is sold off to an Alternate Game Studio, however Fazbear Entertainment likely designates Vanessa to Vanessa to be a part of the Project since it's a pretty big "Security Concern". Vanessa becomes the Games new Playtester & begins reassembling The Scattered Tapes which also reassembles Glitchtrap.
  <br><br>Once all 16 Tapes have been locates, Glitchtrap begins a Digital Consciousness Tranference, & Vanessa uses Tape Girls Instructions to "Eliminate Glitchtrap", however these steps only make it easier for The Digital Consciousness Transference to Complete. To Complete the Process, Glitchtrap locks a piece of Vanessa away in a Safe Room to make space for The Vanny Personality controlled by Him. After that, Vanessa uses the Glitchtrap Plushy as a way to directly communicate with Glitchtrap from inside the Game & uses The Vanny Mask to show Her Commitment to His Plans.
  <br><br>The Safe Room where a piece of Vanessa is Locked Away is not "The Safe Room" but in-fact one located at The East Hall Corner. This placement makes sense considering that Hall Corner contains The Poster of Golden Freddy AKA Cassidy (The Princess) which is who ends up freeing Vanessa in the end. Once that piece of Vanessa is Set Free, it is assumed that this Kills The Vanny Personality, making space for that Piece of Vanessa to return to where it used to be.</p>
  <hr class="documenthr">
  <p class="documentparagraph">The release of The Freddy Fazbear Virtual Experience was likely very successfull, potentially revitalizing the name of Fazbear Entertainment & providing them with funding for The Fazbear Funtime Service & construction of Freddy Fazbears Mega PizzaPlex. The Freddy Fazbear Virtual Experience likely had no traces of Glitchtrap, making for a Successfull Release with his Existence going Unknown to The General Public. Vanessa may have extracted the Entirety of Glitchtrap out of The Virtual Experience for Future Use at The PizzaPlex.</p>
