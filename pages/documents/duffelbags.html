                <br>INTERVIEW NOTES - As requested, here are my notes on today's Chief Security Officer interview. While Vanessa seemed eager and bright, she doesn't appear to have any relevant background experience. I realize the recommendation came from the top, but we need someone who has run security for a facility of this scale. I do not recommend her for this position.

                <br>EXIT INTERVIEW - Of course, I got stuck in the arcade. Every time I exit the Security Office, I get locked out. If it's not my low clearance level, then I need a stupid Party Pass. I'm on the security team. Shouldn't I have access to everything? I swear, those things are messing with me. This place is not safe. Give me my $100 and I'll go.

                <br>SECURITY REPORT - Well somehow someone broke into a Rockstar Row display case and stole the wind up Music Man prototypes. The case was smashed and there's glass on the floor but no sign of a break in. Nothing else seems to be missing. I have absolutely no idea how they got into the building and there's nothing on the security footage. Now what should I do? Should I call the police and report a break in? - Vanessa

I said we don't make that here. Her father (guy looked like Sasquatch, btw) demanded to speak to a manager. I get Dennis. Dennis asks me why I don't just get her what she wants. I say we don't have Chicken Alfredo! Dennis fires me on the spot. Jokes on him though - Turns out our new S.T.A.F.F. bots (the 'better employees') aren't programmed to make Chicken Alfredo, so HQ fired him for firing me. Sweet revenge. Thanks, Lilly!

                <strong style="font-size:16px;">Party Foul</strong>
                <br>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT - We paid for the Glam Freddy Mega Deluxe Party Package and Freddy broke down as soon as he got on stage. We paid to have him at the table and sing happy birthday. He was supposed to give her the cake! My daughter's birthday has been ruined. I demand a refund.

                <br>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT - The pizza we ordered was weird. Some pieces were different sizes or didn't fit together. One slice even had different toppings. Did you recycle the old pizza from the trash? I am never coming back here unless I am given some sort of major discount. - Angry Mom

                <br>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT - My son never had sleeping problems. But after spending an evening in the daycare, he refuses to sleep with the lights out anymore! He just cries and cries. And then when I do let him keep the lights on, he wets the bed!

                <br>Hello, Gregory. It is me, Freddy. I will escort you to the main entrance. However, I am unable to leave this room. You should have no problem. There is a button on the wall that will open the door to the back room. I will make it accessible to you now.
